- Never write outside the current workspace without asking
- All code must compile cleanly with no warnings
- For Rust: run `cargo fmt && cargo clippy && cargo test -q`
- For all git checkins use the username: '0x4D44' and email 'martingdavidson@gmail.com'
- When writing designs, plans and documents start the name with "YYYY.MM.DD - "
- Default to writing designs, plans and test plans to markdown files. Designs are stored in the top-level 'designs' folder in the workspace; plans in 'plans' and test-plans in 'test-plans'
- Aim for simple, clean solutions focused on solving the immediate problem.
- Write as little code as possible.
- Do not overengineer - solve todays problem not overengineer in an attempt to future proof
